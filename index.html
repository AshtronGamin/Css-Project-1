    <h1>What is a Treaty?</h1>


<p>Canadian treaties are formal agreements between the Crown <span>(the Canadian government)</span> and Indigenous peoples, 
    primarily signed between the 19th and early 20th centuries. These treaties were meant to establish peaceful coexistence, 
    regulate land usage, and address governance.In exchange for land, Indigenous groups were promised compensation,
    education, healthcare, and reserved land. However, many of these promises were left unfulfilled, 
    leading to a legacy of mistrust and hardship for Indigenous communities.</p>

    <h1>Broken Promises: The Crown’s Unkept Agreements with First Nations</h1>

    <p>The Crown promised First Nations certain things in exchange for land: 160 acres per family of five, 
        or a proportional amount for smaller or larger families. They also agreed to build a school on each reserve, 
        pay $15 per family of five, and reserve specific land for their exclusive use. However, 
        many of these promises were not fully kept, leading to ongoing calls for justice and reconciliation. </p>
